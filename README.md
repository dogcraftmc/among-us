# Interactive Among Us maps

The code originates from [here](https://langkaws.github.io/) and has been adapted to work with the new map Airship and 15 player lobbies.
The maps have been taken from [the Among Us wiki](https://among-us.fandom.com) or Reddit and are owned by [Innersloth](https://innersloth.com).
This project is not affilated with nor has it been endorsed by Innersloth at all.
